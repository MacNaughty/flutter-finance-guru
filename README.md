Personal Finance Tracker

The release of Flutter 2.0 motivated me to restart this small, simple project.

I plan on using this app to keep track of my personal finances, but it's primarily a practice project.
My main motivation for building it is to show what I know, and to practice Test-Driven-Development and using a local SQL database (sqflite).

I've already been enjoying the experience a lot; it's surprising how much it's helped improve my understanding of app architecture.

First I'll use Firebase as the RESTful API, but I plan to replace it with one I write and deploy (another, separate practice project).
